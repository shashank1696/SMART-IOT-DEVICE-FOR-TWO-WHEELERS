# ABSTRACT
The prime concern now-a-days are the security of parked vehicles. A smart IOT device for two wheelers system is developed which can now not only track the vehicle also alerts the user even the slightest displacement in the vehicle. The device makes use of Global Positioning System (GPS) for the tracking the vehicle and electronic mail (EMAIL) for alerting or notifying the user. The system can exhibit 2 modes i.e., Active mode and Parking mode. In Active mode, the system is off which means the system is not connected to user’s smartphone. In parking mode, the system is connected to a cloud server through Low Power Wide Area (LPA) where the system detects the movement in the vehicle from vibration sensor and alerts the user by sending the location coordinates using GPS. The user also gets a mail that the vehicle is on move and to check the application for location by making use of GSM (Global System for Mobile communication). In future, it becomes a small-size low price device by converting it all into a single chip.

# Existing system
Various vehicle anti-theft devices have been developed lately, however the result is still disappointing since all kinds of devices have its drawbacks.
Domestic and overseas vehicle anti-theft products are technologically classified into two categories: 
1. Vehicle alarm system: 
It consists of an array of sensors which includes switches, pressure sensors, and motion detectors. Often a siren creates a variety of distinct sound that helps user to identify the vehicle. The advanced touch mechanism detects the touch and generates the alarm thereby helping the user to protect the vehicle.                                                                           
2. GPS Vehicle Tracking System: 
This device with the help of GPS and GSM technology tracks and locates vehicles that are stolen. The vehicle is fitted with a device that consists of both GPS and GSM module. Whenever the user asks the vehicle for its location the GPS sends its coordinates through the GSM module. The vehicle also notifies the user when the key position is turned to ignition and the vehicle starts to move. The location of the vehicle is continuously updated to a database even when the user doesn’t ask for the coordinates. Whenever the user requests the coordinates are retrieved from the database and sent to the user. 

## Advantages :
1) Anti theft alarm and vehicle tracking system.
2) Tracking the device using GPS tracker.
3) Saves time in finding the vehicle.

## Disadvantages :
Consumes more energy
GPS tracker is ON 24/7
Doesn't notify the user
In Alarm system, the sound is annoying and its loud too.

## Problem Statement :
In India, 1lakh cases of vehicle theft on average are reported each year, and the number is still increasing. If the vehicles that are being stolen are not recovered early they are mostly sold or some cases it is burned if the resale value is considered to be too low. In one case a vehicle is stolen, it becomes hard to situate it and cut through it, which considerably lessens the chances of recouping it. In this project, we propose the design and implementation of a vehicle tracking anti-theft system that will protect, secure vehicles. 
The main problem in the existing system is that the GPS tracker tracks and monitors the vehicle 24/7 as a result of which it consumes a lot of energy. 
Due to the absence of vibration (movement) sensor the theft of the vehicle cannot be detected immediately.

## Proposed Sytem :
The proposed system uses a switch to turn ON and OFF the device which is controlled by the user/owner. When the user turn OFF the switch, the device goes to active mode. When the user disconnects to the device goes to parking mode and device is connected to cloud server through LPWA (low- power wide range network). When the device is in parking mode, movement of the vehicle is sensed using vibration sensor and the owner is notified along with the GPS coordinates of the vehicle.
