# ABSTRACT
The prime concern now-a-days are the security of parked vehicles. A smart IOT device for two wheelers system is developed which can now not only track the vehicle also alerts the user even the slightest displacement in the vehicle. The device makes use of Global Positioning System (GPS) for the tracking the vehicle and electronic mail (EMAIL) for alerting or notifying the user. The system can exhibit 2 modes i.e., Active mode and Parking mode. In Active mode, the system is off which means the system is not connected to userâ€™s smartphone. In parking mode, the system is connected to a cloud server through Low Power Wide Area (LPA) where the system detects the movement in the vehicle from vibration sensor and alerts the user by sending the location coordinates using GPS. The user also gets a mail that the vehicle is on move and to check the application for location by making use of GSM (Global System for Mobile communication). In future, it becomes a small-size low price device by converting it all into a single chip.
